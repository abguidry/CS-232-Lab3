# CS-232-Lab3
## Intro
This lab code takes a (.csv) list of names and associated addresses and sorts then and outputs a cleaner version similar to what one would list on a contact card.
## Installation
1) To install this program simply:
1) Click the "Clone or Download" prompt
2) Click the "Download ZIP" prompt
3) Choose your desired install location (if not prompted it will automatically download to the User's Downloads folder)
4) Locate your download
5) Extract the "CS-232-lab3-master" folder from its (.zip) folder
6) Move the "lab3b" to the desired directory on your computer
7) Double click "lab3b.jar" to run
## Operation
In general the program will sort a list of comma seperated values (csv) into an array using hashmaps. It will then loop through to the end of the provided CSV to ensure that everyone is matched with their address.
